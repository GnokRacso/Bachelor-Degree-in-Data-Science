Exercise: Computer Vision Notebook
This notebook implements calls to the computer-vsion api based on a key and endpoint you configure in azure. This notebook asks for content categories, a description of the content of the picture, and also identifies objects.

Download the below file to your local machine and unzip it.

Go to notebooks.azure.com and sign in with the account you created earlier. Upload the .ipynb file from the unzipped directory on your machine to a project of your choice. The one I created and used is lqaidemos. Read the markdown and execute the cells by using shift+Enter or by clicking the run cell icon in Jupyter.
